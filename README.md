# AdvanceSyn Toolkit
Modelling and simulation play an increasing role in Systems Science; including Systems Biology, Synthetic Biology, and Metabolic Engineering. However, there are 4 major hurdles for many experimental biologists:

1. Most modelling and simulation tools require the user to be experienced in the mathematical underpinnings, which is in the domain of mathematicians.
2. The implementation of the model requires knowledge of specific modelling language, which is in the domain of computer scientists.
3. Most tools are specific in the modelling language use, which limits inter-operability and cross-utilization of analytical tools. For example, a metabolic model written in MATLAB cannot be used by most tools in systems biology, which tends to use SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language).
4. It is generally difficult and tedious to merge various small models into an aggregate for further use.

**AdvanceSyn Toolkit** is a suite of open-sourced tools for model development and model analysis; with an emphasis on systems biology, synthetic biology, and metabolic engineering. There are 3 objectives of **AdvanceSyn Toolkit**:

1. It aims to flatten the learning curve in model development for experimental biologists by reducing the amount of mathematics to its minimum.
2. It aims to be a model converter between different modelling languages, and enables merger of small models into larger models.
3. It aims to be a platform in which other modelling and simulation tools can be linked and aggregated for inter-operability and workflow development.
